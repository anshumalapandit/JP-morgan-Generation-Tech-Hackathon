# üåü JP Morgan Generation Tech Hackathon: Winner üèÜ

## Overview  
The **JP Morgan Generation Tech Hackathon** is a one-day, design-based technology challenge, offering participants the opportunity to create impactful solutions for real-world problems. On **September 21, 2024**, our team (#20) participated and emerged as winners! üéâ‚ú®  

Our challenge focused on tackling **Gender Equality** through technology. We designed a prototype of an app aimed at empowering women by connecting them with job opportunities, skill-building resources, and access to government schemes in education, healthcare, and finance.

## Highlights of the Journey üöÄ  

### **Hackathon Day (Sep 21, 2024):**  
- **Mastered the Moqups Tool:** Learned how to use Moqups to create a user-friendly interface.  
- **Developed a Comprehensive Solution:** Designed an app prototype with features focused on women's education, employment, and access to government support.  
- **Overcame a Major Technical Glitch:**  
   During the final stages of the design process, a glitch in the Moqups tool erased our entire project. With only **1 hour** left before the submission deadline, our team collaborated under intense pressure to **rebuild everything from scratch**, successfully completing and presenting the prototype on time.  

This challenge demonstrated our resilience, teamwork, and ability to remain calm under pressure, turning a major setback into a moment of triumph.
